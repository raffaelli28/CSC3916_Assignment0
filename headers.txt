Request Headers

User-Agent: PostmanRuntime/7.36.1
    --> User-Agent set by client to indicate information that pertains to the client (got definition from 
    Video posted on Canvas because it is shorter than what I found on Google).
Accept: */*
    --> Accept this is what the client accepts, in this case would be all (same definition situation as above).
Postman-Token: f9aa5b7b-94ae-4506-b5c8-03db25ecb696
    --> Postman-Token is an access token that enables a client to make calls to an API.
Host: www.googleapis.com
    --> Host is the domain name or IP address of the host that serves the API.
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
    --> Accept-Encoding indicates the content encoding (compression algorithm) that the client understands.
Connection: keep-alive
    --> Connection: keep-alive is also called HTTP persistent connection and the idea is to use a single TCP connection
    to send and receive multiple HTTP requests and responses.

X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff

    should be followed and not changed.
Alt-Svc: h3=":443"; ma=2592000,h3-29=":443"; ma=2592000
    --> Alt-Svc allows a server to indicate that another network location can be treated as authoritative for origin when making future requests.
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
    --> Transfer-Encoding indicates a signal to the client that the data will be received in a series of chunks instead of single blocks.



Please NOTE: I have used Google.com, as instructed, to do my research for the terminology above and I have used the definitions found almost exactly but
manually typed.
